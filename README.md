# Slot Machine

A basic text-based slot machine made in Javascript that displays game information in HTML. It uses three random numbers to select the symbols then calculates a score based on the results. Approximately 1/20 full games (starting with $500 and playing until it runs out) can win a jackpot.

This game starts with $500 and will no longer allow the user to play when this is depleted. In the future this may be used as the beginning of a larger game.
